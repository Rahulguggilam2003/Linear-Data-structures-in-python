# Linear Data Structures in Python
This Jupyter notebook implements common linear data structures in Python, including:<br>

->Linked List<br>
->Stack<br>
->Queue<br>
->Deque<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The notebook contains working code examples for creating, manipulating, and using each data structure. To use:<br>
<br>
->Clone the repository<br>
->Open the Jupyter notebook<br>
->Run the code cells to see the implementations in action<br>
<br>
